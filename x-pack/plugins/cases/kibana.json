  "description": "Provides services and functionality related to 'Cases', which are report-like entities that users can leverage to track a situation, collaborate, and add associations to other entities. For example, a user may create a 'Case' because of a security breach. Various users associated with the case can add comments and links to supported visualizations and dashboards. There is a dedicated Cases UI, but this plugin also provides entities for direct integration into other plugins.",
