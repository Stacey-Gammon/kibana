Welcome to Kibana's plugin API documentation! As a plugin developer, this is where you can 
learn the details of every service you can take advantage of to help you build awe-inspiring
 creative solutions and applications!

<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Experimental">
This documentation is being automatically generated using an
 [_experimental_ system](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/rfcs/text/0014_api_documentation.md). That means
 it may be removed or modified. Please create an issue 
 </DocCallOut>

 ## What is included

 Every plugin that exposes functionality for other plugins to use exposes a 
 <DocLink id="kibPlatformIntro" section="public-plugin-api" text="public plugin API"/> (note this system 
 does *not* handle REST APIs). The API documentation system detects this and automatically generates API documentation for
 these public services.

 <DocCallOut title="@internal tags">API items that have an `@internal` in the comment are not 
 included in the documentation system.</DocCallOut> 

 ## How it works

There is one extra step required to have your API docs show up in the _navigation_ of the docs system. Follow
the instructions <DocLink id="docsSetup" section="configure-the-nav-for-your-content" text="here" /> to learn how to 
configure the navigation menu. This is the nav file you will 
be editing: [https://github.com/elastic/elastic-docs/blob/master/config/nav-kibana-dev.ts](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-docs/blob/master/config/nav-kibana-dev.ts)

Your API docs will exist in the top level `api_docs` folder and will use a doc id of the pattern `kib${PluginName}PluginApi`.

If you have a very large plugin you can split up the documentation by adding a `serviceFolders` section into your `kibana.json` that matches
folder names. This will automatically group any API items that are defined in those "service folders" into a separate doc with a doc id of
`kib${PluginName}${ServiceName}PluginApi`. The data plugin does this, so you can check that out as an example.

 ## Handling API changes in PRs

 If you change or delete an existing API, or add a new one, you will have to run the command `node scripts/build_api_docs` in order to update the
 docs in your PR, or CI will fail. When this happens, consider:
 
 1. If this affects an existing API item, have you emailed the `kibana-contributors` list with a heads up? It's important to give advance 
 notice, since there may be corner cases you aren't aware of, even if your PR passes CI.
 2. If the change you are making isn't relevant to contributors, consider a) making the API private, or b) adding the `@internal` flag to it.

If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to the Kibana platform team or create an issue [here](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues).
