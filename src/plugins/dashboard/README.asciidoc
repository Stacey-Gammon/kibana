[[kibana-dashboard]]
== Dashboard

Dashboard is an application inside Kibana that allows users to create and view custom dashboards.

[discrete]
=== Dashboard panels

Dashboard panels are extensible via the <<embeddable-plugin>> API. The dashboard plugin itself
doesn't register any panels (although it is, itself, an Embeddable). These panel types (visualizations,
saved searches, maps, machine learning swimlanes, etc) are registered from other plugins.

[discrete]
=== Dashboard embeddable

Dashboard itself is also an Embeddable. This can be used to embed dashboards in other solutions.

You can view an example of this inside {kib-repo}blob/{branch}/examples/dashboard_embeddable_examples.

Just run Kibana with <<example-plugins>>.
